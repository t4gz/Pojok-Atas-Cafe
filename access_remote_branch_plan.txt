Here is the plan for accessing a remote branch in Git:

1. **Fetch Remote Branches**:
   - Run the command: `git fetch origin` to update your local repository with the latest branches from the remote.

2. **List Remote Branches**:
   - Use the command: `git branch -r` to list all remote branches and confirm that the branch you want to access exists.

3. **Check Out the Remote Branch**:
   - Use the command: `git checkout -b ramdan_a1 origin/ramdan_a1` to create a new local branch named `ramdan_a1` that tracks the remote branch.

4. **Verify the Checkout**:
   - Confirm that you have switched to the new branch by running: `git branch` to see the list of branches and ensure `ramdan_a1` is highlighted.

5. **Pull Latest Changes (if necessary)**:
   - If you want to ensure your local branch is up to date with the remote, run: `git pull origin ramdan_a1`.

This plan will help you access the remote branch `ramdan_a1` in Git.
