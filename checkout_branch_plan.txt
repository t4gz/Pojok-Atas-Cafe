2. **Check Out the Remote Branch**:
   - Use the command: `git checkout -b ramdan_a1 origin/ramdan_a1` to create a new local branch named `ramdan_a1` that tracks the remote branch.

3. **Verify the Checkout**:
   - Confirm that you have switched to the new branch by running: `git branch` to see the list of branches and ensure `ramdan_a1` is highlighted.

4. **Pull Latest Changes (if necessary)**:
