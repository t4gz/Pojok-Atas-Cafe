Here is the plan for creating a remote branch named `ramdhan_a1` in Git:

1. **Create a New Local Branch**:
   - Run the command: `git checkout -b ramdhan_a1` to create and switch to a new local branch named `ramdhan_a1`.

2. **Push the New Branch to Remote**:
   - Use the command: `git push -u origin ramdhan_a1` to push the new branch to the remote repository and set the upstream tracking.

3. **Verify the Branch Creation**:
   - Confirm that the branch has been created on the remote by running: `git branch -r` to list remote branches.

This will allow you to create and track the new remote branch `ramdhan_a1`.
